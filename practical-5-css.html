        <p style="padding:10px;text-align: justify;">CSS is abbreviated as Cascading Style Sheets and is used for describing how HTML elements need to be displayed when they are represented in a web page format or other media. It also helps in saving a lot of work because controlling the layout of multiple web pages can be done all at a time. CSS is said to as the cornerstone design tool of the World Wide Web along with HTML and JavaScript. CSS is intended for enabling the separation of appearance with content, which includes layout, coloring, and font styles.</p>
